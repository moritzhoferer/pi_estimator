# Pi estimator

This probably the most in-efficient way to estimate pi - but it is fun.
It is a frist try to make a *Makefile*.

Stuff for another day to do:
* Maybe I try myself later a bit with parallelization.
* Maybe there is an even less efficient way?! :)
* ~~Write the recorded values in vectors first and output everything into an csv at the end.~~
